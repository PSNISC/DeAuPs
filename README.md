To run the kidWifi.py script you need to have target wifi BSSID.

Generally, to get target wifi BSSID, run "airodump-ng -i IF" in terminal. I run that command on Kali Linux OS.

The purpose of this script is to kid the neighborhood's wifi with the DoS attack.

Note: The interface (IF) must be the same when inserting it into the prompt.
